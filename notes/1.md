# Introduction

Procedural Programming (aka Imperative)
	Model follows from hardware
	Command driven, statement oriented
	Execution changes value of one or more locations in memory
	(ex. C, Pascal, Cobol)

Functional Programming (aka Applicative)
	Look at functions the program represents rather than its state changes
	Results rather than available data
	What is the function that must be applied to the initial state by accessing the initial set of variables and combining them to get an answer.

Rule Based / Logical Programming
	Enabling conditions in certain execution orde

OO Programming
	Compex data objects with limited set of functions
	Concepts
		Encapsulation
		Inheritance
		Polymorphism

Access oriented Programming
	Attaches side effects or demons to variables so that certain functions will be performed as variables are manipulated. 

Constraint Programming
	Similar to logic programming
	Constraints rather than conditions, that must be satisfied to execute.

Parallel Programming
	Computation is defined as taking place with multiple processes.

Three Mechanisms
	Primitive Expressions
		Simplest entities the language concerns
	Means of combination
		Compound elements are built from simpler ones.
	Abstraction
		Elements can be manipulated as units.
