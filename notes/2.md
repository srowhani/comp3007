Lisp and Scheme
	1950s
	Formalism for reasoning about use of recursive equations as model of computation
	Scheme
		1975, Guy Steele and Gerald sussman MIT

Expressions
	Present interpreted expressions, displays result of eval.

Naming and Environments
	Name identifies a variable whose value is object
	Name binds a variable to a computational object
	Interpreter must maintain name-oject pairs
	Memory is called the environment.

Evaluating Combinations
	Evaluation Rule
		Evaluate Subexpressions of combinations
		Apply procedure to resulting arguments

Exception to General Evaluation Rules
	Special Forms
		Has its own evaluation rules. (define, lambda,...)

Compound Procedures
	Combining procedures to form reuslt.

Substitution Model
	Applicative Order Evaluation (Scheme)
		- Evaluate operator and operands
		- Apply the resulting procedure to resulting arguments
		(f 5)
		(sum-of squares (+ 5 1) (times 5 2))
		(+ (square 6) (square 10))
		(+ (times 6 6) (times 10 10))
		(+ 36 100)
		136
	Normal Order Evaluation (expand and reduce)
		- Substitute operand exprssions for parameters until reaching primitive operators
		- Evaluate.
		(f 5)
		(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) ( * 5 2))
		(+ (square (+ 5 1)) (square ( * 5 2)))
		(+ ( * (+ 5 1) (+ 5 1) ) ( *  ( * 5 2) ( * 5 2)))
		(+ ( * 6 6) ( * 10 10))
		(+ 36 100)
		136

Which Evaluation Technique Is Better
	Both result in the same answer
		Generally
	Applicative is more efficient, as it will avoid multiple evaluations.
	Normal Order benefits when dealing with streams.
