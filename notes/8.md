Logic Programming
	Declarative rather than procedural
	Symbolic logic
		Express propositions
		Express the relations between propositions
		Describe how new propositions can be inferred.
Predicate Calculus
	Proposition
		Consists of a set of objects and the relationship they form
		true or false
		Constant or variables

Propositions
	Compound
		functor, ordered list of params
			likes(tony, karate)

Clausal Form
	Problem
		Too many different ways of stating the same thing
		All propositions can be expressed in clausal form
 			B1 ∨B2 ∨ B3 ∨... ∨ Bn ← A1 ∧ A2 ∧  ... ∧ Am
			Left side = consequent
			Right side = antecendent

Resolution
	Inference rule that allows inferred propositions to be computer fro others
	T -> P
	P -> Q
	P -> Q

...
